# twenty-questions

This program implements a binary tree to play a yes/no guessing game of 20 questions. An explanation of the rules: the user 
thinks of an object in which the program will ask less than 20 yes/no questions to guess the object. If the program guesses 
correctly, it wins. If not, the user enters the answer for the program to remember to make it "smarter" for the next game. 

To play, download or clone the project files to a Java IDE and run QuestionMain.java.
